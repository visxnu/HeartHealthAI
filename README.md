# HeartHealthAI

HeartHealthAI is a machine learning-based project aimed at predicting heart disease risks using advanced data analysis and classification techniques. This repository demonstrates how to apply predictive models to healthcare data, helping to identify individuals at risk and enabling early interventions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing with cleaning, normalization, and encoding.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights from the dataset.
- Implementation of classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Visualizations for better understanding and interpretation of results.
- Integration of Explainable AI (XAI) methods for model transparency.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/visxnu/HeartHealthAI.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd HeartHealthAI
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset: Ensure the dataset is in the required format and placed in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
3. Perform exploratory data analysis:
   ```bash
   python eda.py
   ```
4. Train and evaluate the models:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
5. Generate predictions and visualizations:
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```
